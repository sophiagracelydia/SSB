# SSB Interview Process and Experience

Generally, SSB interview is conducted for 5 days in a stretch. Let me explain the entire process and my experience over it.

## Day 1
On the first day we were asked to assemble in front of the SSB 12 selection board Bangalore at 6.AM [5th Nov 2022]. Then they asked us to show the application form, call up letter and 10th certificate. After the first round of verification completed, we were asked to have breakfast and came back for our chest numbers. There were 98 reported initially and my chest number was 55.
