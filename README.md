# SSB Interview Process and Experience

Generally, SSB interview is conducted for 5 days in a stretch. Let me explain the entire process and my experience over it.

## Day 1
On the first day we were asked to assemble in front of the SSB 12 selection board Bangalore at 6.AM [5th Nov 2022]. Then they asked us to show the application form, call up letter and 10th certificate. After the first round of verification completed, we were asked to have breakfast and came back for our chest numbers. There were 98 reported initially and my chest number was 55.

Once getting the chest number we were separated into 3 rows: 1st – Freshers, 2nd – Screened Out and 3rd Repeaters. Then we went to a big hall to complete filling our identification form, xerox copy of 10th, 12th, graduation, 8 semester marksheets and TA (For freshers). After completing our forms, we were taken to AV hall. They gave the instructions for the OIR & PPDT.

### OIR & PPDT (Officer's Intelligence Rating and Picture Perception and Description Test)

In **OIR**, there were 2 tests. Each test for 25-30 mins and 60 questions each (a booklet was given, and we need to fill the OMR sheet to fill Ans).

In **PPDT**, one picture was shown for 30 sec. Then we need to write a simple story for 4 min (I got a picture of a girl standing on a podium speaking and there were 2 other people standing at the back of the stage in front of audience).

After a short tea break, we were split into 15 people and sent to start our group discussion (First everyone needs to give self-written story and then the discussion starts). After the discussion, we went for lunch. Later, they announced the results. From the 98 only 25 got screened in including me (Chest No: 55).

Then we got new chest numbers. This time my chest number was 6. We were asked to submit our phones after informing our families. We went to fill our PIQ forms directly after getting screened in. Then we were taken to the accommodation. By 7 PM we were asked to have dinner, I had severe cold and continuous sneeze at the end of the day. So, slept early to get energy for next day.
