Generally, SSB interview is conducted for 5 days in a stretch. Let me explain the entire process and my experience over it.
* Day 1 - OIR & PPDT
* Day 2 - Psychology Test (TAT, WAT, SRT, SD) + Interview
* Day 3 - GTO 1(GD, GPE, PGPT, HGT, GOR, lecturette)
* Day 4 - GTO 2(IO, CT, FGT)
* Day 5 - Conference

## Day 1
On the first day we were asked to assemble in front of the SSB 12 selection board Bangalore at 6.AM [5th Nov 2022]. Then they asked us to show the application form, call up letter and 10th certificate. After the first round of verification completed, we were asked to have breakfast and came back for our chest numbers. There were 98 reported initially and my chest number was 55.

Once getting the chest number we were separated into 3 rows: \
1st – Freshers \
2nd – Screened Out \
3rd Repeaters \

Then we went to a big hall to complete filling our identification form, xerox copy of 10th, 12th, graduation, 8 semester marksheets and TA (For freshers). After completing our forms, we were taken to AV hall. They gave the instructions for the OIR & PPDT.

### OIR & PPDT (Officer's Intelligence Rating and Picture Perception and Description Test)

In **OIR**, there were 2 tests. Each test for 25-30 mins and 60 questions each (a booklet was given, and we need to fill the OMR sheet to fill Ans).

In **PPDT**, one picture was shown for 30 sec. Then we need to write a simple story for 4 min (I got a picture of a girl standing on a podium speaking and there were 2 other people standing at the back of the stage in front of audience).

After a short tea break, we were split into 15 people and sent to start our group discussion (First everyone needs to give self-written story and then the discussion starts). After the discussion, we went for lunch. Later, they announced the results. From the 98 only 25 got screened in including me (Chest No: 55).

Then we got new chest numbers. This time my chest number was 6. We were asked to submit our phones after informing our families. We went to fill our PIQ forms directly after getting screened in. Then we were taken to the accommodation. By 7 PM we were asked to have dinner, I had severe cold and continuous sneeze at the end of the day. So, slept early to get energy for next day. 

## Day 2
On the next day, we were asked to complete our breakfast by 6.30AM and report at teat point. Then they took us to the AV hall for the psychology. There were 4 tests to analyze our mind. The time was very limited to think and write. This was very challenging.

### TAT (Thematic Appreciation Test)
There were 12 pictures shown in total. Each picture was shown for 30 sec and 4 min to write the story. The 12th picture was blank, and we need to write the story in own.

### WAT (Word Association Test)
There were 60 words in total. Each word was shown for 15 sec only. We must see and write a sentence in that 15 sec. Since after the 15 sec it will change to next word.

### SRT (Situation Reaction Test)
In this SRT, we will be given 60 different situations and we need to write sentences to complete the situation. This was quite challenging since we were given only 10 min for this. I wrote around 53 out of 60.

### SD (Self description)
In this section, we need to write 5 questions in 10 min.
1.	What do your parents think about yourself?
2.	What do your manager think about yourself?
3.	What do your colleague think about yourself?
4.	What do you think about yourself?
5.	What would you want to be in life? 

### Interview
As soon as we completed the psychology test, they called few chest numbers to get ready for the interview. And I was the first person to get interviewed in my batch. The interview was all about the PIQ forms, General Knowledge, and defence related questions. 

Few questions include: -

After completing my interview for 1hour 30 min. Finally, he told me to do the remain tests well and asked to leave. I thanked him and left the room.

## Day 3
All the ground tasks started on the D-3. We were asked to assemble to the ground around 6 AM in the morning wearing white track and t-shirt. The GT were conducted in many aspects to check our team spirit and individual capacity. All the 25, we were split into 3 teams.

### GD (Group Discussion)
We had two topics for the group discussion. First topic can be selected by us. The second topic is given by the GTO. Both the discussions were held for around 10-15 min without conclusion

**Topic 1**: Government has provided several schemes for women benefits what are your views on triple talak, Beti bacha Beti and women in NDA?
**Topic 2**: What are the reasons for the crime against women in India?
.
### GPE (Group Planning Exercise)
In this activity, we were shown a big map and given 4 situations to act upon as team. First, we have to pen down the individual solutions, then discuss the solutions with the team and come to one common solution. 

### PGT (Progressive Group task)
In this activity, we were taken to a swamp land with start line. We were asked to complete to the finish line by crossing it. For challenge, there were some sets of rules which we need to follow. The colour on the rocks shows different instructions. 

**Red** – Cannot be touched by candidates, load and helping material.\
**Blue** – Can be touched by candidates but not by load or helping material.\
**White** - Can be touched by candidates, load and helping material.

## Half Group Task
In the HGT, we were split into team of 2 in the existing team. Asked to complete crossing the finish line by giving solutions.

### GOR (Group Obstacle Race)
This race is also called as **Snake Race**. I enjoyed taking part in this activity was way more than other activity. Since this one is a team activity and a fierce competition between the 3 teams. We had a team shout out called “Dil Mangae More”. There will be series of obstacles, we must carry the snake as a team and complete the race before the other teams.

### Lecturette
For this activity, we were asked to take a card in which 4 topics will be given in the order of difficult to easy. We get 3 min to prepare and deliver the speech for 3 min. My topics include are:
1.	Aviation in India.
2.	Constitution in India.
3.	Energy Efficient vehicles. (I picked this topic and spoke for 3 min)
4.	YouTube vloggers

With these activities the day came to an end. The remaining candidates who didn’t give the interview were called post lunch.

## Day 4
On day 4, we started with second round of the group tasks. We assembled in the group around 6 Am. The weather was so chill and cold. Everyone was asked to do some warmups before the individual obstacles.

### Individual Obstacles
There were instructions given for the obstacles and the marks for each were told. Since the previous night rained all the obstacles were very slippery to handle. There were total of 10 obstacles to be completed. I think I did around 5. 

_Tiger leap, Double Platform Jump, Rope task, Double barrel jump and commando walk._

### Command Task
For the command task, each person will act as a command to give solutions by taking two team mates to solve it. It will happen for around 3 min. 

### FGT (Full Group Task)
This one is very similar to the PGT. In this activity, we were taken to a land with start line. We were asked to complete to the finish line by crossing it. For challenge, there were some sets of rules which we need to follow. The colour on the rocks shows different instructions. 

With this the Group Task come to an end. Our GTO chatted with us and shared his experience in the Indian Navy. The day came to end, and we all had a great time in enjoying the last night as a 25 members team.

## Day 5
### Conference 
At last, the most awaited D Day came to the picture. We were asked to assemble to the tea point with all our luggage’s before the conference. I was super nervous for this since all the officers will be in their uniforms and we will be entering one by one individually to the room.

I was chest number 6. After chest number 5, they didn’t call me inside for more than 10 min. I was super stressed and nervous for this delay. Then they clicked the buzzer and I entered. For my surprise, the entire room felt so great and filled with officers in uniform.

**Me**: Good Morning Sir! \
**Officer**: Hello Sophia, Good Morning. Please sit down. \
**Me**: Thank you Sir. \
**Officer**: So, Sophia you are runner up in group discussion in your school and here also you have managed to get the first mark in the GD. How come it is possible? \
**Me**: Thank you sir. First, group discussion is a platform to share everyone’s thought and to hear them out. I left space for others to talk, and I asked them to let me speak. \
**Officer**: Okay, hmm...well that’s not how the GD works (with a smile). So, tell me the Individual tasks and the tasks which you liked a lot. \
**Me**: Sir, Individual task was quite challenging for me, and I think I did well. I really enjoyed the snake race where we need to compete with others and won. \
**Officer**: Okay. \
